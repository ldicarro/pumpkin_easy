##Pumpkin (Easy)
###Blinks an LED and buzzer when PIR sensor senses motion.

This is a simple circuit and code to add some LEDs and a piezo buzzer to a prop (I used a Halloween pumpkin). In this code, you will see the basics of:

*Defining variables and constants
*Setting up the pin modes
*Reading a sensor
*Checking using an _if_ statement
*Writing a custom function

Should work on most Arduinos but tested on an UNO R3.

There are better ways of doing this using a state machine. This project is meant to introduce concepts of the Arduino programming language. Check out https://github.com/ldicarro/halloween_2016 to see use with a state machine.
